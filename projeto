BitNowCoin is a community of people committed to building sustainable blockchain renewable energy network.



While still in the early stages, BitNowCoin will work to provide a blockchain with smart contracts that will meet the global standard of 91% renewable energy consumption.



BitNwCoin (BNC) will be the common currency of these projects, as it will be used to pay for services, to purchase products related to renewable energies and ecological equipment.
